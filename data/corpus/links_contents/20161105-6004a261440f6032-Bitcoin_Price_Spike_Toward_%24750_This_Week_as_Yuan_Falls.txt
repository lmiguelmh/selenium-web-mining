Bitcoin Price Spike Toward $750 This Week as Yuan Falls
November 5, 2016 18:06 GMT
Bitcoin prices flirted with $750 this week, as Chinese investors turned to cryptocurrency as a refuge from yuan-denominated assets.
The BTC/USD exchange rate ran into volatility in mid-week trading, spiking above $740 before retracing all the way back down to the $700 range. The BTC/USD traded at $703.30 Saturday at 2:02 pm ET, virtually unchanged from the previous close.
Bitcoin trading volumes reached 47 million last week, the highest on record. Most of that action has been taking place in China, where bitcoin exchanges have driven 98% of the digital currency’s transaction volume over the past month.
Bitcoin reached a four-month high of $742.66 on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk.
The US dollar plunged more than 1% this week, as demand for precious metals rose in the lead up to the presidential election. Bitcoin, which is often valued as a haven asset, could experience higher trading volumes in the lead up to the November 8 election. Analysts are forecasting heavy volatility this week should GOP candidate Donald Trump get nominated.
Gold prices also soared last week, reaching $1,300 a troy ounce for the first time in over a month. While digital currency and gold usually move independently of one another, their moves are more closely aligned during periods of  heavy volatility. Bitcoin moved in lockstep with the yellow metal this week as risk-off sentiment dominated the markets. The last time this happened was in the run up to the UK referendum on European Union membership June 23. The so-called Brexit triggered the biggest-ever selloff in global equities.
The CBOE VIX, a measure of US stock market volatility, spiked 40% this week, reaching its highest level since the Brexit aftermath. The so-called “fear index” is trading just above its historical average.
