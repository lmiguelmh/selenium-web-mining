LONDON (AP) — Iceland’s president on Wednesday asked the center-right Independence Party to form a government after it won the biggest share of votes in the country’s election.
President Gudni Th. Johannessson said giving a mandate to Independence Party chairman Bjarni Benediktsson was the “most viable option” for getting a stable government for the Atlantic island nation.The Independence Party — half of a coalition that has governed since 2013 — won 21 of 63 parliament seats in Saturday’s election and will need coalition partners to assemble the 32 seats needed to govern. It could seek support from the conservative Progressive Party or the centrist Regeneration party — though there is no guarantee of success.
The president’s office said Johannessson had asked Benediktsson to report by Monday on the progress of his coalition talks.
Iceland is a volcanic island near the Arctic Circle with a population of 320,000. It suffered years of economic upheaval after the country’s debt-swollen banks collapsed during the 2008 global financial crisis.
