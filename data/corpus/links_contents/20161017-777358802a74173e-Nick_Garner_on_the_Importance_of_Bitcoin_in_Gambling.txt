Nick Garner on the Importance of Bitcoin in Gambling

In this interview with CalvinAyre.com’s Rebecca Liggero, Nick Garner of Oshi Casino explains why he is punting on bitcoin over fiat currencies in relation to gambling.
   There’s no denying that digital currency bitcoin – touted by many as the future of money – has become more and more relevant as trade in online marketplaces continues to grow and expand.
Thousands of businesses around the world now accept the cryptocurrency as it sheds its former image as a currency used as payment for illegal goods online. In fact, reputable e-commerce businesses are beginning to accept BTC as payment, including suppliers of Etsy, WordPress, Overstock, and Amazon.
Even gaming firms are punting on the use of Bitcoin despite the recent bad presses it received such as the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, blackmail FBI Silk Road, and the more recent $72 million bitcoin heist in HongKong.
So why do gambling operators prefer the use of bitcoin?
For Nick Garner of Oshi Casino, he is betting on bitcoin because the cryptocurrency is something that is really integral to the way the internet is going.
He said that Bitcoin remains to be the most transparent commodity since each transaction trace is left in a public ledger known as Blockchain. This helps prevent people spending the Bitcoins themselves more than once.
Garner also pointed out that Bitcoin transactions are faster and quicker.
“But anyway, there’s a whole bunch of reasons why bitcoin was interesting, but underneath all that is just the basics of running a casino,” Garner told CalvinAyre.com. “And the bitcoin is really important, because it’s been a niche for us so we find a little spot and we are able to go.”
Citing his experience as an operator of bitcoin casino, Garner said customers value what he call a “trust footprint.”
He pointed out that they have invested heavily in gaming providers in order to assure their players that they are valued.
“So we’ve done a lot of work to just get out there and be accountable, and have my face on the website so that people will know that there are real people and that if you got a problem you can go to somebody to sort it out,” he said. “We are also using MicroGaming and NetEnt and this big provider. So they’re not cheap assistant, we can’t fiddle around with the RNG numbers on the back end of their games cause we can’t. And I think people just know that it is fundamentally trustworthy. That you will get a return to player of between 95 and 97.5 percent.”

500.com acquires Chinese mobile social poker operator

Chinese online sports lottery operator 500.com has taken a controlling stake in a social poker business in an attempt to diversify its currently non-existent revenue stream.
On Friday, 500.com announced that it had taken a 51% stake in Qufan Internet Technology Inc. and Shenzhen Qufan Internet Technology Co. Ltd, which collectively operate a mobile social poker platform.
500.com says the transaction, which will cost RMB 110.5m (US $16m), is subject to certain unspecified conditions. The company didn’t offer any guidance for what type of boost this acquisition might provide to 500.com’s bottom line.
The Nasdaq-listed 500.com is desperate to show investors some capacity to generate revenue, having now gone six straight quarters without a single penny from online lottery operations following Beijing’s March 2015 decision to ‘temporarily’ suspend online sales after uncovering widespread fraud by provincial lottery administrators.
Investors will likely be hoping 500.com’s latest acquisition proves more permanent that its purchase last December of Zhejiang Shangmeng Technology Limited Company, which operates the Sumpay.cn online payment processor. 500.com sold the company in May, and while it realized a tidy profit on the quick turnaround, it didn’t inspire investor confidence in 500.com’s long-term prospects.
Beijing has been typically cryptic regarding when the 20-months-and-counting ‘temporary’ online suspension might be lifted. In May, five government ministries issued a joint notice detailing steps that needed to be taken in order to ensure future online activity would be property scrutinized, but the government has yet to take any demonstrable public action toward achieving those aims.
500.com isn’t alone in eyeing social gaming as a diversification lifeline. Casino and slots operator Entertainment Gaming Asia has been promising to unveil its new ‘Pan-Asian’ social casino platform since March. Earlier this month, the company reported that it was still “testing the platform in certain markets to assess its potential as a provider to long-term earnings.’
