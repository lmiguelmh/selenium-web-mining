NEW YORK: New York's financial regulator had sights set on becoming a global hub for innovations like bitcoin when it adopted trailblazing virtual currency rules last year. But the state lost that momentum when the agency's chief left, putting a licensing process in limbo and allowing rivals to catch up.

Since June 2015, New York has required virtual currency firms doing business there to get a "BitLicense" to hold customer funds and exchange virtual coins for dollars and other regular currencies.

Benjamin Lawsky headed the Department of Financial Services (DFS) when it developed those rules, acting as an early advocate of virtual currencies when other regulators were still skeptical.

Although it remains unclear whether such currencies will ever gain mainstream acceptance, they are now part of a broader, rapidly-growing industry that blends finance and technology, and which leading financial centers are keen to attract.

For companies, a stamp of approval from a tough regulator offered a chance to win over customers who remained dubious about the product. For New York, it was an opportunity to get ahead of rivals around the world that were also trying to woo "fintech" business.

Yet just after the regulations came into force, Lawsky left the agency. Some senior staffers with BitLicense expertise soon followed him out the door.

Since then, DFS has issued just two BitLicenses. Another 15 applications are still pending, with four others withdrawn and four denied, a spokesman said. Two more virtual currency companies have received trust charters, which treat them more like traditional banks.

"By putting the regulations together and having key staff members leaving almost thereafter, they really put the industry behind the eight-ball in terms of competing with traditional service providers," said Patrick Murck, a lawyer and fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.

Most companies that were operating in New York when the regulations took effect can still do business there while waiting for a license. However, start-ups may face trouble raising money or expanding their business, Murck said.

The virtual-currency industry is miniscule compared to traditional finance, but it has grown rapidly since bitcoin's launch in 2009. There are now other virtual currencies, and broader uses for underlying technologies that create and distribute them. (Graphic: http://reut.rs/1XVt1gH)

The bitcoin market is now worth about $10.7 billion, compared to less than $1 billion just three years ago, according to the information site CoinDesk.

LIGHT VS TOUGH

As the market has grown, financial centers around the world have competed aggressively to attract new business. While some have relied on light-touch regulation, the appeal of New York's BitLicense was that it offered a clear legal framework.

However, the slow licensing process and strict requirements are driving some companies away.

An application costs $5,000 to file, and once completed, can run 500 pages - including everything from compliance manuals to executives' fingerprints, lawyers said. Regulators then drill deeper, asking for details of business models, organizational charts or ownership information.

BitLicense forces companies to "extract personal, private information" from users, creating a target for hackers, Erik Voorhees, chief executive of Switzerland-based virtual currency firm ShapeShift.io, said in an interview, explaining the company's decision not to do business in New York.

GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard told Reuters securing a New York license was not worth the effort: "It's too overreaching and burdensome, especially for the smaller companies," he said.

Marco Santori, who heads the digital currency practice of law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, said at least 15 firms were shunning New York. He has advised clients to focus on states like California, where, he believes, regulators are unlikely to take aim at digital currency companies any time soon. State lawmakers there recently withdrew a second proposal to regulate digital currency companies.

Other states are developing rules and awarding licenses at a faster clip.

Washington State, for example, has issued seven licenses to virtual currency companies since 2013 under its longstanding law for money transfer businesses. North Carolina has licensed two. A uniform virtual currency law that any state can opt into is also in the works, and there has been talk of a possible federal charter.

Internationally, some countries, like Japan, have moved to regulate aspects of digital currency trading, while others, like Bolivia, have banned it. Still others have sought to adapt tax policies and existing laws on money laundering and other illicit activity to the new market. The BitLicense, however, remains a unique approach.

In September, Deloitte ranked New York City No. 3 as a financial-technology destination more broadly, behind London and Singapore.

People familiar with the BitLicense process say the delay in appointing Lawsky's successor sapped some of the momentum.

The new superintendent, Maria Vullo, who took over in June 2016, told Reuters in an interview DFS is striving to clear the application backlog. The reviews had to be thorough, though, because of the risks involved, she said.

New York introduced its BitLicense after the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that lost an estimated $560 million worth of customers' bitcoins.

"It's not a video game," she said. "It involves real money and taking deposits."

Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a digital currency research and advocacy group in Washington, said the BitLicense's roll-out did not live up to its promise. Still, New York's leverage as a world financial center would make it hard for companies that want to grow to shun this market, he said.

"I think it's going to be rare that companies say, 'We're not going to do business in New York.'"

NEW DELHI: In its bid to make travel a more personalised experience, online taxi hailing company Uber has rolled out new features in its riders app.

Features like shortcuts, calendar integration, and people search, promises to make the cab-booking faster and personalised with an improved performance on 2G and 3G networks.

"We rolled out this new app, built ground up globally, with a strong focus on improving on all these fronts," said an Uber spokersperson.

Uber's new 'Destination first' feature lets users choose the destination first as the app asks "Where to?" as soon as the cab-booking process is initiated.

With shortcuts, the app learns from a frequent user's routine and predicts the destinations.

Uber's "Calendar integration", will allow riders to connect their calendar with the app which will mark the user's appointments and meetings as shortcuts.

Additionally, Uber will be soon rolling out a feature that would make the destination of a user not a place but a person.

"We know that people use Uber to meet friends, whether it is at a concert or a night out. This means the rider's destination is often a person," said the spokesperson.

The feature will enable riders to set their destination to a person instead of a place for which the riders will have to sync their contacts with their app, type their name in the search bar.

"Once they have shared their location, the rider will get moving," announced the spokesperson.

The new app, rolled out on November 2 this year, will be available globally on iOS and Android platforms in the coming days.

Now, a new software will protect your laptop, even when it's in sleep mode

Hypnoguard was designed by carefully integrating password-based authentication with widely available hardware security features.
TORONTO: Researchers have designed a new software that can safeguard data even when the computer is in sleep mode.

The powerful new software -- Hypnoguard -- was designed to protect "data-in-sleep".

"Protecting data is especially difficult when a computer goes to sleep, which happens when a laptop's lid is closed, or after a certain period of user inactivity," said Lianying Zhao, a doctoral student at Concordia University in Quebec, Canada.

If a computer in this mode falls into the wrong hands, a malicious person can extract the data found in the machine's random-access memory (RAM) in a number of technical ways, the researchers said.

Once installed, Hypnoguard encrypts the computer's RAM before it enters sleep mode, and then decrypts the data upon waking with hardware-backed uncircumventible user re-authentication.

Hypnoguard was designed by carefully integrating password-based authentication with widely available hardware security features in modern consumer-grade computers, the researchers noted.

"The entire process is transparent to the user, who simply enters a regular 'unlock' password when the computer wakes up," explained Mohammad Mannan, Associate Professor at Concordia University.

"There's almost no impact on usability. For an average computer with eight gigabytes of memory, the process only takes about a second," Mannan added.

Professionals for whom security is paramount -- people like government agents, journalists and businessmen -- should benefit the most in terms of protecting secrets in RAM.

"If their computer is lost or stolen, or if they are forced to reveal their password, Hypnoguard will provide that extra layer of protection," Zhao said.

The software was unveiled at the 2016 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, Austria, recently.

HTC Desire 10 Pro launched at Rs 26,490
Sony launches a99 II A-mount camera at Rs 2,49,990
Specs: 12.6-inch LED touchscreen (2880 x 1920 pixels), Intel core i7 (6th gen), 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Graphics 520, USB type-c, USB 3.0, HDMI, 13MP rear camera, 2MP front camera, Windows 10, 790 grams

Asus was amongst the first brands to offer hybrid Windows devices that can be switched between a tablet mode and laptop mode with docking keyboards. The Transformer 3 Pro is the latest Windows 10 powered 2-in-1 offering from the company in this segment that competes directly with the Microsoft Surface 4.

Design
The company calls it the World's most versatile PC as it is compact enough to carry around and yet powerful enough for heavy duty tasks. Even though the tablet has an alloy metal construction it weighs just 790 grams. Moreover, it is just thick enough to accommodate a full-size USB port. On the right side is a full-size USB port, USB Type-c port, full size HDMI port while the left has volume button and an audio jack. On the bottom side are the magnetic connectors for the keyboard cover. On the rear is the kickstand with a step less hinge (there is no angle click lock when opening and closing the stand). Impressive thing is that the hinge can open to 155 degrees for comfortable viewing. Overall, the Transformer 3 Pro feels well-built and can easily handle day to day travel without you having to worry about scratches and dents.



Display
It has a 12.6-inch LED touchscreen with a resolution of 2880 x 1920 pixels. The screen has excellent brightness levels, shows vivid colours and has wide viewing angles. Touchscreen response is top-notch too. In terms of specifications, the screen has a275 ppi pixel density and Asus claims it has 121% sRGB colour gamut coverage making it great for editing images and videos. The resolution of the tablet makes it easy to work with multiple windows and even working with apps such as Microsoft excel doesn't feel cumbersome. The screen is great for watching movies as well as playing games. Asus even preloads its display control software that lets users switch between normal, vivid and an eye-care mode that enables a blue-light filter.

Transformer Cover
Transformer cover is a revamped docking keyboard that comes with the Transformer 3 Pro. It is the first offering from Asus that doubles up as a screen cover when closed. The top of the cover has a smooth matte finish adding a better grip on the device. It connects to the tablet via 'pogo pin' connectors and snaps perfectly in place using magnets. The keys have good travel and much to our liking they are backlit - this makes it easy to use the device even in dark environment. The trackpad is large and responds well - however at times we felt that the buttons were weak to press and felt hollow. The other issue we noticed is that at times, the mouse pointer starts to move on its own when the cover is connected - we had to adjust the sensitivity of the trackpad to fix the issue.

Hardware & Performance
Asus claims that this is the slimmest 2-in-1 device to come with a 6th generation Intel Core i7 processor. Other specifications of the Transformer 3 Pro include 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Thanks to this combination, performance is top-notch. We had no issues in using Photoshop and Lightroom on the device and it even played 4k videos without any issue. We tried games such as Counterstrike: GO and even Call of Duty Advance Warfare on medium graphics settings. We could get just over 4 and half hours of battery backup. What impressed us further was the minimal heating of the device. Even in the slim design and such powerful components, the tablet only suffered from minor heating issues thanks to the vapor chamber cooling technology used by Asus. The vapor chamber contains coolant liquid that covers the internal components to keep them cool along with an ultra-thin 3m fan. All-in-all, the Transformer 3 Pro delivers top-notch performance for its compact size and portability.



Multimedia
Transformer 3 Pro comes with stereo speakers powered by Harman/kardon. The audio output is amongst the loudest we have seen on a 2-in-1 device. Asus has also integrated their SonicMaster technology that enables optimized audio output with wider audio range and sharp vocals across games, music and movies. The tablet has dual cameras - a 13MP rear camera and a front 2MP camera. The rear camera is as good as a mid-range phone camera - good clarity in daylight and indoors but there is visible noise. Front camera also suffers from visible noise but the video quality is good for occasional video calls.

Conclusion
Asus's Transformer 3 Pro proves to be a worthy successor and in our opinion gives stiff competition to the Microsoft Surface 4. It has a Core i5 processor variant that is priced at Rs 1,10,990 while the Core i7 variant is for Rs 1,44,990. In comparison, the Surface Pro 4 with Core i7, 8GB RAM and 25GB SSD costs RS 1,44,990 making the Asus transformer a better offering in the same price.

Google glass technology may not be safe for drivers, says new study
MOSCOW: Using Google Glass, Siberian scientists are developing a prototype of a model to study an individual's proneness to certain brain diseases at an early stage, media reported.

The scientists are using Google Glass to study how people react to virtual reality and analysed the participants' movements in virtual reality, rbth.com reported on Thursday.

"They evaluated the condition of the muscles, the brain and the vestibular system. There is a difference between the vestibular system's reaction in healthy people and that in sick people," said Ivan Tolmachev, one of the model's developers.

The test requires the person to be aware of what is happening around and follow the doctor's instructions.

The scientists are thinking of conducting the test on children who are five and older in order to understand if they are already prone to brain disease, noted the report.

Scientists from Tomsk Polytechnic University and the Siberian State Medical University are together working on this prototype and the project will need $64,000 to make the model marketable.
