Samsung Announces Voluntary Top-Load Washer Recall
By

Posted on November 4, 2016
Business Wire reports that Samsung has announced a voluntary recall of specific top-load washers manufactured between March 2011 and current production.
Risks reportedly include the drums in the washers losing balance during the high-speed spin cycle. Excessive vibration as a result can cause the top to separate from the washer and presents a risk of injury to consumers.
Customers with a recalled washer can receive either free in-home repair to reinforce the washer’s top and a year-long extension of the manufacturer’s warranty regardless of age or a rebate toward a new Samsung washer (or other brands) along with free installation and removal of the old model.
Customers who choose to purchase a new Samsung model will receive an additional $150 loyalty incentive toward the purchase. Additionally, customers who purchased a recalled washer in the past 30 days are eligible for a full refund from the place of purchase.
Samsung advises owners to use the delicate and waterproof cycles when washing bedding, water-resistant or bulky items until the repair is complete or the washer exchanged.
