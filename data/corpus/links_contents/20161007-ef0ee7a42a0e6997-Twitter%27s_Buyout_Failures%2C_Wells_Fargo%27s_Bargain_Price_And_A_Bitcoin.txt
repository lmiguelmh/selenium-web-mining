Summary
October 6, 2016, Market Overview (0:18 - 1:30).
Twitter is a solid platform with a decent business model and poor management (1:30 - 7:15).
Are Samsung's explosive devices giving Apple an opportunity? (7:20 - 10:40).
Wells Fargo's management track record is in question but the stock is a bargain (12:17 - 20:42).
Bitcoin offers an intriguing uncorrelated value for risk-tolerant investors (20:43 - 29:06).
In Thursday's episode, the crew examines whether Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) still has bargaining power as an acquisition target and how Samsung's exploding devices may positively impact sales of the mostly uninspiring iPhone 7 from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Later, Ben Nye takes a deep dive into the black eye Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has received in the wake of its falsified account scandal and questions whether the damage is truly a knockout punch.
Finally, Matt Krebsbach leads an educational session on Bitcoin (OTCQX:GBTC) investing.
Disclosure: I am/we are long WFC, AAPL, WMT.
