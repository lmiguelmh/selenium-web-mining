Bitcoin price jumps as investors flock to safety after Donald Trump election victory

t has often been seen as one of the most volatile and risky assets around, but even Bitcoin was seen as a safe haven in the wake of Donald Trump’s historic US election victory, as investors flocked to the digital currency.
Bitcoin rose by as much as 4.6pc against the dollar on Wednesday and was close to a 35-month high against the pound amid a global sell-off.
Bitcoin - often referred to as a form of digital gold by its supporters - has historically been defined by its unpredictability. In 2013 its value rose from less than $10 to over $1,000 before a breakdown in confidence and collapse of a key online exchange sent it plummeting.
However, growing confidence in the currency and global uncertainty about other assets have seen Bitcoin’s price roughly double since the start of the year. On Wednesday its price touched $742.96, within touching distance of the $777 it reached shortly before Britain’s EU referendum in June, although it fell below $730 in later trading.
The move mirrored rises seen by other safe haven assets. Gold, silver and the Japanese yen all rose on Wednesday as the dollar and global stock markets fell. Prices of such safe havens typically rise amid major investor uncertainty and a lack of confidence in other investments more exposed to the economy, such as stocks and bonds.
Bitcoin’s entry into this club marks a potential maturity point for the cryptocurrency, or to look at it another way, shows what an unprecedented situation Trump’s victory is.
In December 2013, Bitcoin rose to around $1,200 but collapsed when Mt Gox, the most popular online exchange, was hit by a cyber attack that saw many users lose thousands.
