NEW YORK (AP) — A former Palm Beach County, Florida, school board official has pleaded guilty to a federal charge in New York City.
Other charges against Michael Murgio related to a bribery case are being dropped in exchange for the plea to attempting to obstruct examination of a financial institution.
He entered the plea Thursday in Manhattan federal court in a deal with prosecutors calling for a sentence of up to a year and four months in prison.
The 65-year-old Murgio was on the school board when he was arrested in April by the FBI.
Murgio told a judge he knew what he was doing was wrong when he tried to mislead a financial probe.
His son is awaiting trial on charges he ran an unlicensed bitcoin exchange to help criminals launder money.
