Bitcoin price soars as Trump pulls ahead
By Joseph Adinolfi
Published: Nov 8, 2016 11:51 p.m. ET
Bitcoin prices soared as Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump pulled ahead of his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, rattling stocks and sending safety plays like gold sharply higher. Bitcoin was up 2.6% at $724 in recent trade. The bulk of trading volume was conducted in U.S. dollars, according to CoinMarketCap.com, suggesting that U.S.-based investors were responsible for the surge.
