Anonymous hacker group Shadow Brokers is now threatening to publish the NSA´s hacking tools' password to everyone who pays $6.3 million or 10,000 bitcoins. This action comes weeks after the group complained how nobody was interested in the bidding, wanting the tool for free.
Stolen NSA Cyberweapons Are Real
The group who´s claimed responsibility for stealing and leaking powerful cyberweapons believed to be used by cyberteam Equation Group, have been in a contradictory situation, since many experts ended up confirming the legitimacy of the NSA´s hacking tools, most of them capable of skirting enterprise firewalls. However, they also explained that this action is incredibly nonsense, considering the fact that bitcoins are extremely traceable, as reported by Softpedia.
"TheShadowBrokers is being bored with auction so no more auction. Auction off. Auction finish. Auction done. No winners. So who is wanting password? TheShadowBrokers is publicly posting the password when receive 10,000 btc (ten thousand bitcoins). Same bitcoin address, same file, password is crowdfunding. Sharing risk. Sharing reward. Everyone winning." The hacking group told recently in a blog post, in which it also announced to leak a conversation between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch in an airplane.
Shadow Brokers Offer Is Predestinated To Fail
According to the International Business Times, Shadow Brokers initially released around 60 percent of the entire cache for free, including zero-day vulnerabilities against Cisco, but failed to garner any response. Apparently, this new offer can also be predestinated to fail, considering the lack of interest that people have showed about NSA´s cyberweapons.
Although the group´s background and it still unknown, four different sources recently told that the NSA think that Russian hackers might be involved. Apparently, these cyber criminals got hold of the exploits after a contractor or even an employee was careless enough to leave them available on a computer. Is very likely that this situation happened about three years ago, after an operation in which the NSA had to use the tools.
