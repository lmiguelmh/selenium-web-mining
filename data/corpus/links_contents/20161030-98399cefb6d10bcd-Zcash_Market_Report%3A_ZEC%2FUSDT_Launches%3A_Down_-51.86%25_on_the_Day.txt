VOLUME
The 24 hour volume on Poloniex is 14602.97760750 USDT or 16.52976358 ZEC.
REMARKS
The much heralded Zcash has launched for trading on a number of exchanges. The opening price was USDT$9,000 per Zcash on Poloniex. While the price is fluctuating strongly we are seeing a prominent downtrend from the opening high. The closing price at press time was the daily low – with a new fat red candle forming.
Notwithstanding the launch overpricing of the digital asset, traders recognize that Zcash could have very real advantages over other altcoins.
