State Street will serve as the administrator and transfer agent for a long-gestating bitcoin fund created by the Winklevoss twins, the brothers who famously fought Mark Zuckerberg over ownership of Facebook.
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both Harvard graduates, have been developing a first-of-its-kind exchange-traded fund tied to the virtual currency bitcoin since 2013. The product has yet to receive approval from federal regulators. Other firms are racing to put a bitcoin ETF on the market as well.
The fund may receive a boost from the enlistment of State Street (NYSE: STT). As administrator, the Boston financial giant would be responsible for maintaining the trust’s books and calculating its net asset value, according to a securities filing this week.

The product has another Boston connection: Law firm Ropes & Gray has been hired to counsel the brothers regarding the fund.
The shares will trade on the BATS exchange under the symbol COIN, if they are approved by regulators.
The Winklevoss twins sued Zuckerberg claiming that he stole their idea for Facebook while the three of them were Harvard students, a legal fight dramatized in the film "The Social Network." They ended up settling with the social-media giant.
