SWISS Federal Railways (SBB) announced on October 31 that the digital currency Bitcoin will be available to purchase at station ticket machines from November 11, as part of a two-year trial.
SBB passengers will be able to exchange Swiss Francs for the digital currency Bitcoin at all ticket machines, but it will not be accepted as a method of payment.
SBB is providing ticket machines as a Bitcoin distribution channel for financial services company SweePay, and the digital currency has gained attention because of its low transaction fees.
Transactions will be limited to SFr 500 ($US 507) each, and will be available through the entire distribution network of more than 1000 ticket machines.
