Bitcoin Prices Breakout on Saturday
October 22, 2016 20:33 GMT
Bitcoin prices surged on Saturday, reaching their highest level in nearly three months, as buyers returned to the digital currency arena after a volatile summer season.
The BTC/USD exchange rate spiked 3.9% to $654.52 at 3:31 pm ET, according to CoinDesk. The pair is on track for its highest settlement since July 30.
The latest recovery in prices is partially attributed to stronger liquidity, a sign of improved confidence in the market. Since September 21, more than 80% of speculative positions on bitcoin have been long, according to digital currency trading platform Whaleclub.
Prior to the summer downturn, bitcoin was enjoying a period of growing stability thanks to greater mainstream uptake. For many in the investment community, bitcoin’s finite supply and blockchain infrastructure make it ideal for diversification purposes.
Analysts have also noted a major change in market confidence over the past two weeks, as investors looked past a series of negative news headlines involving bitcoin. The currency’s value declined sharply over the summer after nearly 120,000 bitcoins were compromised in a high-profile security breach at Hong Kong-based broker Bitfinex.
Bitfinex is reportedly seeking a deal with the hacker to recover the lost funds. In a blog post on Saturday, the company said it wanted to offer “clear instructions” on how to communicate with the hacker. Bitfinex had previously offered to give 5% of the value of the stolen coins to anyone who provided information that could lead to their retrieval.
