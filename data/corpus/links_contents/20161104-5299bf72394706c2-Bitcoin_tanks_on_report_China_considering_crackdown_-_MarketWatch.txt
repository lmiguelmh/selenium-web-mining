Cryptocurrency hit a low of $687 overnight

Under pressure.
The bitcoin price plummeted late Thursday, erasing a week’s worth of gains, as a blistering rally ran out of steam.
A Bloomberg report that Chinese authorities are studying measures to limit transactions on China-based exchanges in an effort to stop money flowing out of the country was the catalyst for the selloff, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of Cryptocompare, a provider of cryptocurrency data and analysis.

Bitcoin US:BTCUSD  has rallied sharply in recent weeks, from $630 on Oct. 19, to a four-month high of $743 earlier Thursday. It touched a five-day low at $687 early Friday morning New York time.
The rally coincided with a sharp increase in trading volume on China-based exchanges. According to Bloomberg, Chinese authorities believe some of these investors are using bitcoin as a vehicle to illegally move money out of the country, while others might be using it simply as a hedge against the softening Chinese yuan USDCNY, +0.0332%
