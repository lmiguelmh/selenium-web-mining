Gemini Bitcoin Exchange Services Now Available In Singapore and Hong Kong
JP Buntinx October 4, 2016 Cryptocurrency, News
The Gemini exchange team has been working hard to improve their services as of late. Not only did they expand to Canada, but they are also running daily Bitcoin auctions right now. Things continue to look up for the Winklevii, as they have received the green light to offer their services in Hong Kong and Singapore as well.
GEMINI IS COMING TO ASIAN COUNTRIES
One of the primary objectives of any Bitcoin exchange is to expand on an international level. Asia remains the biggest market for the cryptocurrency, due to its many speculators. Gemini, the exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, has expanded to Singapore and Hong Kong. Both countries have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrency as of late.
Residents living in either Hong Kong or Singapore can use the Gemini exchange to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum as of today. For now, only Bitcoin, Ether, and US Dollar traders are available. However, the company will add HKD and SGD order books in the coming weeks as well. No specific timelines were announced at the time of publication, though.
The Daily Bitcoin Auction, which has garnered some interest in the Gemini exchange already, is available to Hong Kong and Singaporean Gemini users as well. This should give this initiative a more global appeal and open the bidding to millions of potentially new clients–an exciting development that will fortify Bitcoin’s position as an investment vehicle.
But the journey for Gemini will not end here, as the team is continuing to explore other countries as well. The Asian market has always been keen on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and Gemini wants to make a name for itself in this industry. Although it remains unknown which countries may be next on the list, it is not unlikely that China and Japan are on the list somewhere.
Bitcoin is a global currency that attracts interest from investors all over the world. Gemini, while being fully licensed in the US, has a big appeal to mainstream investors. Although the trading volumes remain somewhat small, breaking into the Asian market may shake things up a bit. Once HKD and SGD trading is enabled, things could get interesting very quickly.
