PALM BEACH GARDENS (CBS12) — Michael Murgio, former member of the Palm Beach County School Board, is scheduled to plead guilty for making a false statement to the New Jersey National Credit Union, according to new court documents.
"Mr. Murgio regrets this lapse in judgement and has accepted full responsibility for his actions," Murgio's lawyer, Stuart Kaplan said in a released statement. "(He) is looking forward to putting this chapter of his life behind him."
The change of plea hearing is scheduled to take place on Thursday at 2 p.m.
Murgio was arrested by the FBI on April 21st. He was named in a superseding indictment in connection with a federal case against his son, Anthony R. Murgio.
The FBI alleges a business run by Murgio's son, Anthony Murgio, was unlicensed and utilized to knowingly launder money from illegal enterprises.
Authorities arrested the younger Murio in July 2015, accusing him of operating a Bitcoin operation with another defendant, Yuri Lebedev.
Michael Murgio was indicted in New York in April and charged with bribing a New Jersey credit union. Federal agents say the move enabled Murgio's son's illegal operation involving the unregulated internet currency Bitcoin.
Murgio wass a board member for District 1 of the Palm Beach County School Board. He served as a school principal for 20 years in Palm Beach County's North area schools which included Jerry Thomas Elementary, Lake Park Elementary, West Riviera Elementary and Inlet Grove High School, according to his bio.
