Summary
Bitcoin is recovering from the Bitfinex hack, just very slowly.
The effect of the hack is still having effects on liquidity and BTC pricing.
We still think BTC eventually heads over $1,000, but it may just take longer than expected.
By Scott Tzu
We are bullish on bitcoin and just a couple of months ago we wrote about the Bitfinex exchange hack that caused a momentary crash in bitcoin prices from over $600 to, at one point, under $500. We made the argument that price will once again stabilize before moving to $1,000 in this article, when we wrote,
But the most important thing about the story is that we have progressed since the first real security breach where hundreds of millions of dollars were lost. Another part of the bitcoin story continues to evolve, and we believe the question of whether or not bitcoin has been validated is long in the past.
Now, it is simply just setting up contingency plans and ideas for when the unexpected occurs that remains for those furthering their bitcoin ventures. Bitcoin pushes forward into the future.
This was a nice resolution to a story that shook the bitcoin underground for a couple of days. As with everything bitcoin thus far, there has been resolve and continued buy-in for the digital currency. These incidents seem to only be making the community stronger, and this is why we think bitcoin continues to have a long runway for growth going forward.
But now, it looks as though things are taking a little bit longer than we had expected to recover. We have finally taken back the $650 level we were at prior to Bitfinex, though it has taken nearly 3 months.

We are long bitcoin for the long term, so this is OK with us. We have a long-term investment horizon for bitcoin, but we wanted to update our readers about why price expansion is taking a little bit longer than we thought it would.
