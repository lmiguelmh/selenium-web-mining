Bitcoin IRA Launches New IRA Calculator Tool for Investors
The new bitcoin investment calculator is designed to help both individuals who already have an IRA or 401(k), as well as new investors looking to start saving for retirement. By comparing potential returns from bitcoin with traditional investments, they can better determine the risks and benefits associated with each option.
The calculator was developed by Bitcoin IRA, the first company to offer bitcoin-based retirement accounts. A Bitcoin IRA is similar to traditional and Roth IRAs, but allows investors to hold actual bitcoins in a secure digital wallet for their retirement.
In addition to the investment calculator, Bitcoin IRA also offers a free investment guide, which is available for download. Investors looking to start their own Bitcoin IRA can speak with a specialist by calling 1-877-936-7175 Monday through Friday, between 8:00 AM and 5:30 PST, or by emailing to info@bitcoinira.com. They can also request a call back by completing a short online form.
