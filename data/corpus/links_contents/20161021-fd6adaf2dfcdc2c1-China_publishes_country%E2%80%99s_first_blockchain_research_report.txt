China publishes country’s first blockchain research report

Bitcoin’s growing popularity is being felt across the world, and this is particularly evident in China—a country that sees a significant majority of the global bitcoin trading.
Digital currencies currently don’t have a legal status in China, although experts have been attributing the recent surge in the price of bitcoin to the hearty demand from the Chinese market due to fears of Chinese yuan devaluation. However, it appears that the Chinese government is starting to get with the times.
This week, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) came out with a white paper that explores the applications of blockchain—the technology behind popular digital currency bitcoin.
The research paper, titled “the Blockchain Technology and Application Development Whitepaper,” details the applications of blockchain technology, especially in the finance sector. According to the paper, blockchain can be applied in several scenarios, such as supply-chain management, analyzing finance, entertainment, smart manufacturing, social welfare, education and employment.
Wang Zohongmin, vice chairman of China’s National Council for Social Security Fund, said blockchain has the potential to enhance payment channels.
“There’s no doubt that blockchain technology will be used in the social security system because of its valuable applications in the investment and management of social security funds,” Wang said, according to Cryptocoins News.
The research paper is the latest indicator of China’s changing stance on cryptocurrency and blockchain.
In June, Chinese media outlets reported that the Chinese government is planning on having a set of laws that will offer digital currencies a “legal status” in the country. The draft law, released as part of the People’s Republic of China General Principles of Civil Law, aims to consider cryptocurrencies as properties “almost on par with physical and financial assets,” meaning they will be under the scope of the civil rights related to property in general.
Current bitcoin price and trade volume
The price of bitcoin dropped to $627.5 early Friday morning, with a trade volume of $7.29 million.

500.com acquires Chinese mobile social poker operator

Chinese online sports lottery operator 500.com has taken a controlling stake in a social poker business in an attempt to diversify its currently non-existent revenue stream.
On Friday, 500.com announced that it had taken a 51% stake in Qufan Internet Technology Inc. and Shenzhen Qufan Internet Technology Co. Ltd, which collectively operate a mobile social poker platform.
500.com says the transaction, which will cost RMB 110.5m (US $16m), is subject to certain unspecified conditions. The company didn’t offer any guidance for what type of boost this acquisition might provide to 500.com’s bottom line.
The Nasdaq-listed 500.com is desperate to show investors some capacity to generate revenue, having now gone six straight quarters without a single penny from online lottery operations following Beijing’s March 2015 decision to ‘temporarily’ suspend online sales after uncovering widespread fraud by provincial lottery administrators.
Investors will likely be hoping 500.com’s latest acquisition proves more permanent that its purchase last December of Zhejiang Shangmeng Technology Limited Company, which operates the Sumpay.cn online payment processor. 500.com sold the company in May, and while it realized a tidy profit on the quick turnaround, it didn’t inspire investor confidence in 500.com’s long-term prospects.
Beijing has been typically cryptic regarding when the 20-months-and-counting ‘temporary’ online suspension might be lifted. In May, five government ministries issued a joint notice detailing steps that needed to be taken in order to ensure future online activity would be property scrutinized, but the government has yet to take any demonstrable public action toward achieving those aims.
500.com isn’t alone in eyeing social gaming as a diversification lifeline. Casino and slots operator Entertainment Gaming Asia has been promising to unveil its new ‘Pan-Asian’ social casino platform since March. Earlier this month, the company reported that it was still “testing the platform in certain markets to assess its potential as a provider to long-term earnings.’
