Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may be considered to be the least popular presidential candidates in the history of American politics, but that hasn’t stopped punters from pouring in a record number of wagers into betting sites.
The recently held 2016 U.S. presidential elections has been called the biggest non-sporting betting in the UK’s history, surpassing even the Brexit referendum, with punters spending more than £150 million on the outcome.
Bitcoin betting sites, such as Fairlay, BitBet, Predictous and BetMoose, also experienced a surge during the election season.
In an interview with Brave New Coin, a Fairlay representative said that a single political bet on its site attracted 4,356 predictions, which are worth an estimated $956,000 at current digital currency exchange rates.
“Overall, people won around 2000 BTC (bitcoins) betting on Trump,” Fairlay said, according to the report.
The betting sites said the number of bitcoin made during the November 8 election has “grown dramatically,” compared to the 2012 presidential election, when bitcoin was still in its infancy.
“People were very passionate about betting during the US presidential election season, and were also very passionate during the whole Brexit affair,” a spokesperson for the BitBet website told the bitcoin news outlet
