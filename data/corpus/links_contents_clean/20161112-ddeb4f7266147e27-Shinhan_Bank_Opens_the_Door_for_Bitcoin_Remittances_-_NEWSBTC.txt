Shinhan Bank in Seoul is establishing a new bitcoin remittance service between its native Korea and neighboring region China.

Migrants working outside their native borders are often made to look for alternatives in order to provide for their families. Currency exchange rates tend to invoke large fees and even dismiss certain portions of one’s earnings, but bitcoin has proven to be a turning point in this arena.
