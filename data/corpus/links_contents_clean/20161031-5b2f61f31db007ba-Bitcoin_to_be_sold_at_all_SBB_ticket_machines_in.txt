31 October 2016  •  Author: Katie Sadler, Digital Content Producer, European Railway Review
Swiss national rail operator SBB has announced the digital currency Bitcoin will soon become available to purchase at all station ticket machines as part of a two year trial.
From 11 November 2016, SBB customers will be able to exchange Swiss Francs for the digital currency Bitcoin at all station ticket machines. However, Bitcoin is currently not accepted as a method of payment to purchase tickets.
With very low transaction fees, the digital currency has gained attention as a way of moving transferring money rapidly.
SBB is providing the ticket machines as a Bitcoin distribution channel for financial services company SweePay. Transactions will be limited to 500 Swiss Francs (£415 / $500) each.
Until now, there have been limited opportunities to purchase Bitcoin in Switzerland. According to SSB, its dense distribution network of over 1,000 ticket machines, available round the clock, is not only suitable for purchasing tickets, but also allows additional services to be obtained.
