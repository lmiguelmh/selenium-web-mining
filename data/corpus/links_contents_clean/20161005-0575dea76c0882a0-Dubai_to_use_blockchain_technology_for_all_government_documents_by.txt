Dubai to use blockchain technology for all government documents by 2020 - Gulf Business
The Dubai government is seeking to position the emirate as a leader in blockchain technology
Dubai has announced plans to use blockchain, the database technology behind crypto currency bitcoin, for all government documents by 2020.
Dubai Media Office said in a tweet the strategy was launched earlier today by Crown Prince of Dubai and chairman of Dubai Executive Council Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Blockchain was originally designed as the distributed database list system behind bitcoin. It is intended to record every transaction using the currency that ever occurred in a tamper and revision proof record.
In recent years fintech firms have been exploring its use in other database systems.
Dubai itself has sought to position itself at the forefront of the technology through recent initiatives.
In May, several government bodies announced that would explore the technologyâ€™s use in areas including healthcare, wills and diamond transactions.
