Travelers on Switzerland's railways will soon be able to buy Bitcoin at more than 1000 ticket machines.
The country's national rail service, SBB, will start selling the cryptocurrency at all machines next month under a deal with SweePay.

Travellers will be able to buy up to CHF500 in the currency, using a QR-code-based wallet and providing their mobile phone number for identification.
