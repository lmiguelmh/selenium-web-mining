ipple’s CoinMarketCap chart threw up unexpected numbers this morning. Whether an error or a rabid surge, Ripple registered an explosion in market capital early Monday morning (GMT), scaling from $270 million to $1.2 billion. Trading volumes have more than doubled to over $8.7 million.
A look at the listed markets shows an entry, Ripple Gateways, driving the trading. Notably, it was buying XRP at a price of nearly $0.045 (now down to $0.039 at the time of publishing).
An observer on Reddit pointed to the inclusion of XRP at a London-based trading platform with a focus on cryptocurrency derivatives, behind the bullish surge.
