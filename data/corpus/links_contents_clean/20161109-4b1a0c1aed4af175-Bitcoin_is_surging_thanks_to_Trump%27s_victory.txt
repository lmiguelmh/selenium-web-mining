Today is a strange day for the US — even though you might not have seen it coming, Donald Trump is now president-elect. And that’s doing some interesting things to the cryptocurrency markets.
According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin prices have been steadily rising as Trump’s victory was looking more and more real throughout election night. At its highest point the popular cryptocurrency reached $738, up from a low of $703 around the time polls in the US were closing down. As America wakes up again right now, the price seems to have slightly dropped to $725.
