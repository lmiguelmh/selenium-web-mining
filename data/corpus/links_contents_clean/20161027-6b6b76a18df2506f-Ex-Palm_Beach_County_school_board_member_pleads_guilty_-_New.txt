Ex-Palm Beach County school board member pleads guilty - New Jersey Herald -
NEW YORK (AP) â€” A former Palm Beach County, Florida, school board official has pleaded guilty to a federal charge in New York City.
Other charges against Michael Murgio related to a bribery case are being dropped in exchange for the plea to attempting to obstruct examination of a financial institution.
He entered the plea Thursday in Manhattan federal court in a deal with prosecutors calling for a sentence of up to a year and four months in prison.
The 65-year-old Murgio was on the school board when he was arrested in April by the FBI.
Murgio told a judge he knew what he was doing was wrong when he tried to mislead a financial probe.
His son is awaiting trial on charges he ran an unlicensed bitcoin exchange to help criminals launder money.
The biography page of Railroad Earth's website hasn't changed much over the years. It's basically a confused discussion about what kind of music the band plays.
