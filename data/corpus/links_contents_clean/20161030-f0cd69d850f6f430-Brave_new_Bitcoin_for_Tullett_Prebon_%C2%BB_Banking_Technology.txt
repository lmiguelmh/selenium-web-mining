Tullett Prebon Information (TPI), a provider of real-time price information from the global OTC financial and commodity markets, has signed a deal with Brave New Coin (BNC) to distribute its digital currency data.
TPI says this is the “first time such a comprehensive view of the entire digital currency landscape has been made available to financial markets”. The data provides pricing from more than 50 digital currencies – including Bitcoin – as well as traded rates against a variety of traditional currencies.
Andrew Reeve, head of Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa at Tullett Prebon Information, says it is “starting to see more acceptance of crypto-currencies, with companies such as Microsoft and Amazon accepting them as payment and we know our customers want to see a consolidated view of the market”.
The agreement allows TPI to distribute BNC’s consolidated exchange feed, including the Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX), to their customer base. TPI says this represents the bulk of the exchange traded liquidity for digital instruments, at a time when daily volumes for the entire digital currency marketplace frequently top $500 million.
The latter has partnered with GMEX Group to develop a hybrid voice and electronic trading platform for FX Options; and opened a new tech centre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to boost innovation and increase its IT capacity.
