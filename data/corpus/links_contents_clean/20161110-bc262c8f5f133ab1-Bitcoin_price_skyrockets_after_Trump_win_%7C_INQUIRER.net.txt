Donald Trump’s election win sent shockwaves to markets around the world. And not just in traditional markets but also in the cryptocurrency world where the Bitcoin price skyrocketed.
At $738, the cryptocurrency rose around 3% from an earlier $708 mark overnight. However, the jump did not happen to other forms of digital money, reports Fortune.
Another form of cryptocurrency like Ethereum and Ripple, which are the second- and third-biggest in the market have gone down by 2% and 1% respectively, according to a Coinmarketcap report.
Bitcoin’s jump in market value is acting as a vindication that it is a haven in times of market volatility. The cryptocurrency has also enjoyed a long period of relative stability in the second half of 2016. Yet, despite the positive trend, its current value is still far from the all-time high of $1,200 that it experienced back in 2013. Alfred Bayle
