Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are an organizational concept that allows for trustless contracts between distributed participants. WINGS combines the DAO concept with decision-making using decentralized forecast markets, while making this accessible to anyone with a smart phone.
San Diego based Airbitz allows users to securely access a multi-blockchain world using a single sign-on while retaining control over their private keys and authentication. Developers can now leverage the Airbitz’s open-source SDK for their decentralized apps (dApps), instead of having to create their own security solutions from scratch.
“We’re excited to partner with Airbitz and offer this to the WINGS DAO community,” said Boris Povod, WINGS Core Developer. “Airbitz lets people easily interact with DAOs using stored encrypted private keys, and anyone can login simply with a username/password.”
“WINGS, much like Airbitz, is committed to delivering a user-friendly experience for people interested in using blockchain assets in their applications,” said Airbitz CEO Paul Puey. “Our partnership with WINGS will make interacting with the next generation of DAOs a seamless and accessible experience. We’re proud to add WINGS to the growing list of premier blockchain apps powered by Airbitz Edge Security.”
