BitPay ramps up security of bitcoin wallet Copay with Intel hardware security integration
BitPay, a leading bitcoin payment processor company, has announced that it has integrated its bitcoin wallet Copay with the Intel Software Guard Extensions and Intel Identity Protection Technology (Intel IPT) with protected transaction display (PTD) security technologies.
With this, Copay has become the first bitcoin wallet with Intel hardware security integration. BitPay said that this new solution will allow Copay users to rest assured that their data is better protected even if their application code or associated computer is compromised.
“Providing user-friendly financial security is one of bitcoin's biggest opportunities, and Intel's silicon-based security helps us move bitcoin closer to the mainstream,” said Stephen Pair, CEO at BitPay. “We look forward to releasing this to Copay users in the coming months.”
The Intel Software Guard Extensions integration offers hardware-level protection for the bitcoin wallet’s private key generation, transaction signing and private keys themselves. It will make Copay an even safer true bitcoin wallet alternative to bitcoin account services, which are vulnerable to security breaches.
With this integration, users will be able to execute an application's most security-sensitive operations using the new 7th Generation Intel Core processors.
“The decentralized trust which blockchain technology enables has the potential to transform interactions over the Internet, starting with bitcoin. With blockchain technology and our security and computing assets, Intel hopes to bring decentralized trust to a wide array of asset exchanges over the Internet,” said Rick Echevarria, vice president of Software and Services Group, and General Manager of the Platforms Security Division at Intel.
BitPay expects to announce the general availability of the new integration soon. The firm believes that businesses that rely on Copay to receive and send high volumes of bitcoin payments will find this integration to be a welcome security tool.
