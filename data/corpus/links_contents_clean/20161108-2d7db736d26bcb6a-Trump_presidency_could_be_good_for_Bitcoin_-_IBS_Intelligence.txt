 The US presidential election is permeating every strata of global society, it seems. Understandably, though, there have been financial questions over Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, especially over what their impact could be on markets.
It seems there is a widespread belief amongst Bitcoin investors that a Trump presidency would provide a boost to the price of the cryptocurrency. Hindsight points towards the $100 rise in price Bitcoin received in the wake of Brexit as a precedent. Trump’s position as a Washington outsider may put global markets on edge, say analysts, something that will see more and more people turning to Bitcoin as an alternative.
Any boost to the price of Bitcoin would only add weight to an increasing reputation as a safe haven away from the fluctuating traditional currencies.
“I think a Trump presidency would be great for bitcoin, much like nuclear war would be great for bitcoin,” Jacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency hedge fund manager, tells CoinDesk. “It would be an epic disaster in a bunch of respects – economic, geopolitical, democratic – and in the fear and chaos bitcoin would be a defensive asset people could turn to.”
