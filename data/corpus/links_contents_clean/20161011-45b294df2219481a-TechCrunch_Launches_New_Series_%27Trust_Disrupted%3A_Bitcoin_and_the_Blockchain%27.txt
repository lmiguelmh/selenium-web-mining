The six-episode series will focus on bitcoin future and people behind the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is a relatively young cryptocurrency. Much time and efforts are needed for people to get used to it. In order to provide additional education in the sphere of bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain, TechCrunch has started an exclusive web series on its YouTube Channel on October 10.
The series called “Trust Disrupted: Bitcoin and the Blockchain” is based on the book Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper. It is produced by Stateless Media and TechCrunch. The series will feature experienced bitcoin developers, influencers and scholars tracing the history of bitcoin and analyzing its future. TechCrunch informs that in total it is planning to create six episodes.
The first episode went live on Monday. It started with words of Nathaniel Popper:
“Bitcoin first emerged in 2008, the initial paper and software came from someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea behind the system was that it would be a financial network outside the control of government, outside the control of banks …”
The first episode focuses on the notion of blockchain, the technology that allows bitcoins to be transferred between entities, as well as the motives behind its creators. The episode touches as well the topic of the platform’s future, the attitude of governments and big banks to the cryptocurrency since its creators wanted to sidestep these very institutions.
According to TechCrunch, the second episode will be devoted to the global network of mines and miners that govern the bitcoin system.
“Even more fascinating than the idea of a digital currency are those who dedicate their lives to it. A network of miners all across the world, many of whom are in China, run the system. They not only process every Bitcoin transaction, but they also play a large role in governing the platform, for better or for worse,” says TechCrunch.
“Episode two looks at where these Bitcoin mines are developing and who is behind them. It also explores the role of these miners, the decision power that they possess and the delicate balance of power required for the platform to operate in the way in which it was intended.”
The third episode is planned to explain how to deal with the flood of traffic to the network – the main question is whether it should be centralized or decentralized. The topic of overall promotion and acceptance of cryptocurrencies will be raised in the fourth episode.
The fifth episode will be devoted to Ethereum and the last one will look into the recent debate between the Open Blockchain (Silicon Valley) and the Closed Blockchain (Wall Street).
