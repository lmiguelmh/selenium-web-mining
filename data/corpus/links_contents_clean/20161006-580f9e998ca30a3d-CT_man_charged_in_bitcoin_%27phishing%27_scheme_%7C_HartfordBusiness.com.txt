A Wallingford man who federal authorities say was caught stealing other people's identities and their electronic currency has been arrested on fraud charges that could land him in prison for nearly six decades.
Michael Richo, 34, was arrested Wednesday on a criminal complaint charging him with access-device fraud, computer fraud, wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering offenses in connection with a scheme to steal bitcoins in an online phishing scheme, according to the New Haven office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut U.S. Attorney's office.
Richo, who is free on a $100,000 bond, faces up to 57 years in prison if convicted on all charges, authorities said. Richo could not be immediately reached Thursday for comment.
According to investigators, Richo engaged in an online phishing scheme to steal bitcoins from individuals on the dark web. Bitcoins are a form of electronic currency and online marketplaces on the dark web typically accept them as a payment method.
The complaint alleges that Richo posted fake links to online marketplaces on dark web forums. The links directed individuals to a fake login page that looked like the real login pages for the various online marketplaces.
When individuals attempted to log in, Richo stole his or her username and password, investigators said. Once he had an individual's username and password, Richo monitored the individual's bitcoin balance at the real marketplace. If the individual later deposited bitcoins with the real marketplace, Richo withdrew the bitcoins before the individual could spend them and caused the stolen bitcoins to be deposited into his own bitcoin wallet.
Richo then sold the stolen bitcoins to others in exchange for U.S. currency, which was deposited into a bank account that RICHO controlled.
The complaint alleges that RICHO had over 10,000 stolen usernames and passwords saved on his computer. Investigators did not say how many bitcoins, or their value, were purloined.
However, prosecutors' charging papers against Richo contain email snippets in which the self-described "hacker'' boasts of living in a beachfront home and driving a Mercedes-Benz. He also indicated his alleged scam generated thousands of dollars in "income'' for him.
Money laundering carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, prosecutors say. Wire fraud carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years; access device fraud carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years; computer fraud carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years; and aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory term of imprisonment of two years.
The FBI investigated the crime, which is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Neeraj N. Patel.
