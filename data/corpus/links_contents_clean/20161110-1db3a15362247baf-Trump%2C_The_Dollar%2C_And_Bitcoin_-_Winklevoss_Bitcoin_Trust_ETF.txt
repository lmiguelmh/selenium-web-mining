Trump, The Dollar, And Bitcoin - Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (Pending:COIN) | Seeking Alpha
Trump's victory in the presidential election, combined with a Republican Congress, is making for quick changes to the investment landscape. The dollar has rallied and will likely continue with volatility. The peso has already dropped quickly with Trump's win. At the same time, many countries, including China, are trying to devalue their currencies to keep their exports competitive.
This rally will continue with many of Trump's key policies. He wants large multinationals like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to bring back overseas profits, which would drive demand for dollars. He thinks the Fed has been too dovish. In addition, actions by foreign central banks will also push the dollar up.
At first thought, a stronger dollar is negative for Bitcoin (COIN, OTCQX:GBTC); in reality, it is not. Bitcoin is a world currency, and people are turning to it when their governments devalue their home currencies. The largest driver of this is China. If the yuan devalues at a faster and faster rate, the Chinese will increase their use of Bitcoin. The Chinese are already using it to circumvent capital controls and move their wealth outside of China. Events like United Kingdom voting to leave the EU show the unstable nature of fiat currencies. Bitcoin has rallied this year - 88% versus USD, 99.5% versus CNY, and 126% versus GBP. So while domestic demand for Bitcoin may simmer, international demand would fill the void. This year's rally has been fueled by strong demand from China. Trump also wants to block remittances to Mexico. Family members in the United States could turn to Bitcoin to circumvent any regulations.
