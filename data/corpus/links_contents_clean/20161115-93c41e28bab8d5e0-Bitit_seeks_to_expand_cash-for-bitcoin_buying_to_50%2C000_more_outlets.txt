FxWirePro: DASH/ USDT faces strong resistance at 21- day MA, good to sell on rallies
Bitit, a Paris-based startup company, is teaming up with distribution network specialist Neosurf and plans to expand its network to up to 150,000 retailer stores, CoinTelegraph reported.
Bitit is a prepaid Bitcoin gift card from €25 to €250 that can be redeemed into bitcoins. The company has also partnered with Flexepin to launch cash-for-Bitcoin buying in over 15,000 convenience stores in Canada and Australia. Earlier in March, it launched a new initiative to enable consumers purchase bitcoins from 100,000 physical stores across the globe.
The startup has also collaborated with Cashlib, currently available in France, and is now enabling bitcoin purchases through Cashlib vouchers.
“Bitcoin by cash market is only just beginning. Vouchers payment methods allow us to better mitigate risks and reduce costs. By using our network, thousands of users can now buy Bitcoin over the counter as easy as any other product”, Bitit CEO Nicolas Katan told CoinTelegraph. “Now French users will have the choice to obtain Bitcoin either through Neosurf or Cashlib. Until now, there have only been limited opportunities to purchase Bitcoin with cash in France.”
Flexepin and Cashlib vouchers are available in different denominations, ranging from $25 to $500 each. By offering multiple choices of vouchers, Bitit says that it is targeting the unbanked population in Europe, Canada and Australia helping them to access latest payment technologies as well as the e-commerce world.
Once a user acquires a voucher, they simply need to enter the voucher code on Bitit website and redeem it in Bitcoins. Bitcoins are sent as soon as confirmation of the voucher code is received.
I agreed totally! I was 12 years old when I found out there was no Santa, I felt such a pain, because I then realized that all along my parents had done a great sacrifice to buy things for us, we were poor, and I had not fully appreciative, that I vowed to myself, that if someday I had children I would tell them that God enables parents work, providing them means to buy to their children what they need! But later I found out other sad things in the world, children without parents, children with parents that do not care, children with parents too poor for a gift... We do not live in a perfect world...
