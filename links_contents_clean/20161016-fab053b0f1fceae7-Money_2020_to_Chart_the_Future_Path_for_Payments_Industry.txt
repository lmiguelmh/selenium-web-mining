Money 2020, one of the leading financial and payments conference is preparing for its 2016 edition, scheduled for October 23-26. The event happening at the Venetian in Las Vegas focuses on blockchain technology, fintech, and related regulatory aspects.

Among the speakers are Brian Armstrong from Coinbase, John Beccia from Circle, Perianne Boring from the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Vitalik Buterin from Ethereum Foundation, Chris Church from Digital Asset holdings, Jacob Farber from R3CEV, Peter Kirby from Factom, Bobby Lee from BTCC, Jed McCaleb from Stellar and more.
As conventional banking and financial institutions continue to explore the use of blockchain technology in their operations, this event will bring both cryptocurrency and mainstream financial industries together. The main focus of this year’s Money 2020 event will be on regulations and innovation in fintech sector, which includes Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency regulations.
The payments industry has been one of the fastest growing industry sectors in the past few years. Even before Bitcoin payments picked up, electronic payments involving cards, mobile payments, NFC-based contactless payments and others have been gaining traction. The upcoming conference will be instrumental in setting the pace for the future of payments industry.
According to reports, the Money 2020 event will also focus on making the existing payments options more attractive for merchants by combining loyalty programs and features. It may also include possible collaborations between mobile services providers and financial institutions for effective sharing of user data, which can be used to provide customized offerings for the customers for better conversion.
Cryptocurrencies have already carved a position for themselves in the payments industry. With increasing adoption, mainstream payment solutions providers have started to include Bitcoin support alongside their regular fiat payments offerings. The same trend is expected to continue even after the Money 2020 conference.
