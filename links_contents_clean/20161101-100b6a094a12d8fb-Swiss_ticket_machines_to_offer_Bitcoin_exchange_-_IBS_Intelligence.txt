Swiss ticket machines to offer Bitcoin exchange - IBS Intelligence
 Switzerland’s national rail service (SBB) is planning to sell Bitcoin at its stations. From 11 November customers will be able trade their francs for Bitcoins using ticket machines, though they won’t be able to buy tickets with the cryptocurrency.
The project is two years in length and was launched following SBB gauging customer interest in Bitcoin and other digital currency. Users will be able to make transactions by confirming a mobile number and can exchange a maximum of 500 francs. Though one Bitcoin is around 700 francs currently, it’s possible to buy a fractional figure.
“There have been few possibilities to obtain Bitcoins in Switzerland until now,” SBB says. “With its 1,000-plus ticket machines, SBB operates a dense, around-the-clock distribution network that’s suited for more than just ticket sales.”
