Florida Man To Plead Guilty in JPMorgan, Bitcoin Hack Case
In Manhattan District Court today Michael Murgio will admit to operating an illegal money transmitting business and paying a bribe to gain access to a credit union.
Michael Murgio from Florida will plead guilty in a Manhattan court today in the illegal bitcoin exchange case tied to the JPMorgan hacking investigation, his lawyer confirmed according to Reuters.
Murgio is the second person to plead guilty in the case under a plea agreement. He is charged with operating an illegal money transmitting business and paying a bribe to gain access to a credit union.
The Florida lawyer is charged along with his son Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, who operated Coin.mix, owned by Israeli Gery Shalon. According to the news agency, Shalon, Ziv Orenstein and Joshua Samuel Aaron ran a massive hacking operation which attacked the networks of companies like JPMorgan Chase and compromised personal data of more than 100 million people. Coin.mix was allegedly used by the hackers to exchange millions of dollars in bitcoins.
Murgio is also charged with bribing the chairman of a New Jersey credit union, pastor Trevon Gross, to use the institution as a front for Coin.mix.
