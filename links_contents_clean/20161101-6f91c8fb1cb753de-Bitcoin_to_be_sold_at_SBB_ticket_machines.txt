Bitcoin to be sold at SBB ticket machines
SWISS Federal Railways (SBB) announced on October 31 that the digital currency Bitcoin will be available to purchase at station ticket machines from November 11, as part of a two-year trial.
SBB passengers will be able to exchange Swiss Francs for the digital currency Bitcoin at all ticket machines, but it will not be accepted as a method of payment.
SBB is providing ticket machines as a Bitcoin distribution channel for financial services company SweePay, and the digital currency has gained attention because of its low transaction fees.
Transactions will be limited to SFr 500 ($US 507) each, and will be available through the entire distribution network of more than 1000 ticket machines.
