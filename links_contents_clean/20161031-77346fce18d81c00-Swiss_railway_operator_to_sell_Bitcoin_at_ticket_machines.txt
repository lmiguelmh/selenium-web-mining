Swiss railway operator to sell Bitcoin at ticket machines
31 October 2016  |  3922 views  |  1
Travelers on Switzerland's railways will soon be able to buy Bitcoin at more than 1000 ticket machines.
The country's national rail service, SBB, will start selling the cryptocurrency at all machines next month under a deal with SweePay.
SBB says that it has made the move following two years of investigation into whether there is market for selling Bitcoin.
Travellers will be able to buy up to CHF500 in the currency, using a QR-code-based wallet and providing their mobile phone number for identification.
However, the machines will not accept Bitcoin as payment for tickets.

"However, the machines will not accept Bitcoin as payment for tickets." Reminds me of a leading electronics chain in Germany. It launched a cobranded credit card for branding but wouldn't accept it at its own stores!
