Bitcoin IRA Introduces Gold Rebate Promotion for New Clients
Bitcoin Press Release: Groundbreaking retirement investment company introduces new gold rebate as investors see gains of over 40%.
October 20, 2016, Los Angeles, CA – Bitcoin IRA, the first and only bitcoin-based retirement investment company, today announced the introduction of a gold rebate for new clients. While supplies last, investors who open an account with Bitcoin IRA will automatically qualify for a rebate in the form of gold eagle coins. The rebate is available to all new customers, giving them an extra incentive to save for retirement with an innovative, fast-growing alternative investment.
epending on the size of the account they open, new investors are eligible to earn up to a full ounce of gold:
● INR 999,940.8 ($15,000) bitcoin investment = 1/10 oz. gold eagle coins
● INR 2,333,195.19 ($35,000) bitcoin investment = 1/4 oz. gold eagle coins
● INR 4,666,390.38 ($70,000) bitcoin investment = 1/2 oz. gold eagle coins
● INR 6,666,271.97 ($100,000)+ bitcoin investment = 1 oz. gold eagle coins
Since Bitcoin IRA officially launched in May, the value of bitcoin has risen almost 40%, climbing from INR 30,131.55 ($452) per bitcoin to INR 42,464.15 ($637) as of October 20th. This is expected to grow significantly over the long term as a result of bitcoins’ limited supply and increased usage, making a bitcoin IRA potentially much more profitable than conventional IRAs.
Bitcoin IRA offers both traditional and Roth IRA options, which offer the same tax incentives as regular IRAs and 401(k)s. Uniquely, the retirement portfolios are made up of actual bitcoins, which are stored in a secure, private digital wallet. In addition, investors keep total control over their bitcoin deposits, with no holding fees and the ability to withdraw once the term is over.
In addition to the gold rebate, Bitcoin IRA offers a similar rebate for silver, giving customers the option to receive a 1% rebate in real silver in exchange for opening a new account.

Bitcoin IRA is the only bitcoin-based retirement investment portfolio that allows people to invest with actual bitcoins for their IRA or 401(k). The platform works with leading fintech professionals to provide secure, high-quality bitcoin investments.
