BTCUSD Price Technical Analysis: Waiting for More Sellers
BTCUSD seems tired from its strong climb in the past few months, as price failed in its attempts to break past $740. Price has formed a double top and is testing the neckline at $680. A break below this level could push bitcoin down by $60 or the same height as the chart pattern.
