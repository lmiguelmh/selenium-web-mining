Shopawl.com, a drop-shipping service that enables shopping with bitcoin on one of China’s biggest online shopping sites, Banggood.com, has added AliExpress.com to its list of supported stores.
In addition to bitcoin, Shopawl enables shopping on the supported stores also with Ethereum/ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin (Dodge) and DASH with more cryptocurrencies to be added.
AliExpress, a global e-commerce platform that comprises small business sellers offering a wide variety of consumer products worldwide, is the third store the drop-shipping company has added to its list. The firm had previously added eBay, but with the announcement of the addition of AliExpress, the company also proclaimed on its blog post the removal of eBay from its list of stores.
The decision to remove eBay, says the blog post, was taken because of some payment problems that usually occur with different sellers from different countries. However, Shopawl does say it will look into it and try its best to add eBay again, as unlike AliExpress, says the post, branded products like laptops and smartphones are much easy to find on eBay.
Until that happens, Shopawl says that using any of the supported digital currencies, its users will be able to buy branded items such as those by Dell, Lenovo, Acer and other companies from its own, upcoming store.
Fees for AliExpress orders, says the Shopawl blog post, will be the same as eBay orders – 2% for less than 100 USD-valued products and 5% for products valued above 100 USD. A much larger range of products can be found on AliExpress
Mentioning the reasons behind the decision to add AliExpress to its stores list, Shopawl’s blog post says that the global e-commerce platform has “much larger range of products and also they have good shipping economies so much more shipping methods at cheapest price.”
AliExpress enables consumers from all over the world to buy directly from manufacturers and wholesalers in China and provides access to a wide range of products at wholesale prices. AliExpress is a business within Alibaba Group.
