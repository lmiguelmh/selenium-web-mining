PALM BEACH COUNTY (CBS12) — A former Palm Beach school board member is expected to plead guilty in a federal bribery investigation. Mike Murgio is due in federal court in New York Thursday afternoon.
He had resigned from the Palm Beach County school board in April when he became a target in a federal investigation focusing on his son, Anthony.
Investigators say Anthony Murgio was running an illegal bitcoin exchange operation. His father Mike tried to bribe bankers in an effort to cover up what he was doing.
Court filings show the feds will drop the bulk of their bribery and corruption case in exchange for Murgio pleading guilty to a single lesser charge.
Murgio could get up to five years in prison, although his attorney says that's something they're hoping to avoid altogether.
Murgio is scheduled to leave Florida at 7 a.m. and will make his plea 2 p.m.
