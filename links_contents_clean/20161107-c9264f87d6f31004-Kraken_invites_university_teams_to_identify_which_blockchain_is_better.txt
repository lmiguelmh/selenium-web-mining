Kraken invites university teams to identify which blockchain is better – Bitcoin or Ethereum
The Kraken Case Study Competition that is hosted by The Economist's Which MBA? site has invited university teams to submit a proposal that would predict which blockchain technology is the better long-term buy among Bitcoin or Ethereum. The winning team will receive a grand prize of $10,000.
The participating team of universities and business-school includes the University of North Texas, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Ivey Business School at Western University, Tulane University, Middlebury Institute of International Studies, among others. The teams predicted two-to-one that a bitcoin-weighted portfolio is a better long-term investment than Ethereum, the release stated.
“The teams must look at strengths and weaknesses of each technology and their use cases, adoption, project governance, developer and investor sentiment, historical performance and global regulatory issues. The complexity of this evaluation coupled with the tremendous upside potential for a correct bet is why we felt this was the perfect question for this challenge," Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken said.
The team winning the second place will be awarded $5,000, and third place will receive $3,000 in prize money. The top three winners will be selected by Kraken and there will also be a people's choice award of $3,000 awarded to the team whose proposal receives the most votes from the public. The winners will be announced in December 2016.
