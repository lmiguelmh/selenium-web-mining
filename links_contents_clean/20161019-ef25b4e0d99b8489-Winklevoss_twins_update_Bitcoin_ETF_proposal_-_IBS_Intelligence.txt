Winklevoss twins update Bitcoin ETF proposal - IBS Intelligence
 Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have filed amendments to their original proposal for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), naming State Street as a key administrator in its development. The first application for the ETF, set to be named the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, was filed three years ago.
According to the amended filing, State Street will provide fund administration and accounting service, as well as calculating the trust’s net asset value. A similar change has involved Gemini Trust Company, an offshoot of the Winklevoss’ Gemini Bitcoin exchange, performing proof of control exercises and publishing the results.
“The sponsor and the custodian have engaged an independent audit firm to verify that the custodian can demonstrate “proof of control” of the private keys that control the Trust’s on a monthly basis,” states the filing. Gemini’s daily auction price at 4PM will also be used to price the asset value of the ETF.
Gemini recently started daily Bitcoin auctions, accepting two-sided bids in either Bitcoin or dollars for the next day’s listing in the afternoon. yler Winklevoss told CoinDesk that by concentrating liquidity at a single moment each day there will be a minimal risk of “slippage” from investors affecting prices with their purchases.
Gemini recently expanded into Canada, though for the time being Canadian users will only be able to trade their Bitcoins, as opposed to buying them. Future updates will enable the purchasing of Bitcoins or Ether for US dollars. Gemini was the first licenced Ether exchange in the world, gaining approval from the Department of Financial Services in New York state.
