What You Need To Know About Cybersecurity, WikiLeaks, And Bitcoin
Andrea O’Sullivan is the program manager of the technology policy program for the Mercatus Center where she combines her interests in economics, cryptology, alternate currency, and emerging technologies. She joined the Federalist Radio Hour to discuss the recent hackings of government data, Hillary Clinton’s emails, and the future of Bitcoin.
Institutions and countries are facing cybersecurity vulnerabilities all over the world. “You just have to assume that any time any information that’s out there can be compiled… in this time of big data that’s a real concern both in terms of good governance and national security,” she said.
With the increase of hackers and as the government takes a more active role in shutting down bank transactions of companies at their discretion, many consumers are investing in alternate currencies. “The important thing about Bitcoin is not necessarily anything about it’s monetary properties…at its heart it’s important because it’s a censorship resistant protocol,” O’Sullivan said.
