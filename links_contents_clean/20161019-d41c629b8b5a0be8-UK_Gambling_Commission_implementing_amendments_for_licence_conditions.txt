UK Gambling Commission implementing amendments for licence conditions
The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (GC) will be amending the current licence conditions and codes of practice (LCCP) in a move to improve prevention of gambling-related crime as of October 31.
Changes include all licensees now being required to report all gambling-linked criminal investigations they are involved in and where the GC may be expected to question whether the licensee’s measures were sufficient to prevent gambling crime.
The GC will also consolidate the anti-money laundering requirements set out in the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code 2013. Licensees must assess and manage the risk of their business being used for money laundering and the financing of terrorism. This will affect both local and foreign brands that operate in the UK.
Operators will now be required to have effective policies and procedures in place for handling cash and cash equivalents. Licensees will have to ensure adverts do not appear on sites that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted content.
In a statement the GC said: “We think that the most effective regulatory approach is to focus on the outcomes we expect operators to achieve. In some areas we specify particular rules or processes, but where possible, we aim to allow licensees to take differing approaches to meet our requirements; this includes using rapidly developing technological tools and data analytics. We have powers to take action against licensed operators who fail to comply with the conditions of their licence or codes of practice.”
