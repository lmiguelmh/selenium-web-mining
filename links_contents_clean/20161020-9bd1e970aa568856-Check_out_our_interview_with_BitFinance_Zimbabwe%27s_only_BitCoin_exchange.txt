Check out our interview with BitFinance Zimbabwe’s only BitCoin exchange covering bond notes, cash crisis, BeForward deal & its Block Chain Summer School!
Posted 20 Oct 2016 by Batsirai Chikadaya (@adroa91)
Late last week we had the opportunity to sit and talk with Tawanda Kembo Zimbabwe’s very own BitCoin evangelist and also Lead Developer for BitFinance the only local BitCoin exchange. The conversation touched on various issues affecting Zimbabweans including the current cash crisis, impending introduction of Bond Notes, the BitCoin-Beforward deal and their Block Chain Summer School starting soon.
It’s not the first time we’ve had Mr Kembo join us to discuss BitCoin but as we’re all looking for hacks to deal with the current economic situation we thought of BitCoins so we invited him over once again.

Then there’s the issue of trust. Need I remind you of the disasters and losses that have happened in Bitcoin exchanges
