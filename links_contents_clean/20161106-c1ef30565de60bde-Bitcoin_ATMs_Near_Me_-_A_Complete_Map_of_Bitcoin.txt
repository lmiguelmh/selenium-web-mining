Bitcoin ATMs Near Me – A Complete Map of Bitcoin ATMS
BY OFIR BEIGEL ON NOVEMBER 6, 2016 - UPDATED ON NOVEMBER 8TH, 2016
With the recent price surge in Bitcoin I’ve been getting a lot of questions about buying Bitcoins with cash. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Bitcoin ATMs it’s basically a physical machine that allows you to deposit fiat money (i.e. Dollars, Euros, etc.) and withdraw Bitcoins straight to your Bitcoin wallet.
Here’ a short example of how it works:
Today I want to show you the complete list of Bitcoin ATMs around the world courtesy of CoinATMRadar. Just find your location and see where is the nearest location you can get Bitcoins. Some ATMs allow you also to deposit Bitcoins and withdraw cash. So if you’re looking to cash out on your early Bitcoin investments this is also a good solution.
Each ATM takes a certain commission from the exchange and it varies, so make sure you’re aware of the fees before starting out. The map above also allows you to search for Altcoin ATMs if you want to buy/sell other cryptos.
If you’ve had any experience with using Bitcoin ATMs I’d love to hear it in the comment section below.
Blogger and owner of 99Bitcoins. I've been dealing with Bitcoin since the beginning of 2013 and it taught me a lesson in finance that I couldn't get anywhere else on the planet. I'm not a techie, I don't understand "Hashes" and "Protocols", I designed this website with people like myself in mind. My expertise is online marketing and I've dedicated a large portion of 99Bitcoins to Bitcoin marketing.

I’ve used the ATM in Tokyo. Hard as hell to find, and required quite a wait. Worked fine.
