WorldCoinIndex offers real-time market data for global cryptocurrency community
WorldCoinIndex has announced the release of a new blockchain market data resource platform, which offers reliable, real-time price information and the latest news updates for over 400 listed cryptocurrencies to the global cryptocurrency community.
The platform allows users to access a wide range of data points from over 35 different cryptocurrency exchanges and track cryptocurrency prices in all major fiat currencies such as USD, euro and yuan.
On the website, the cryptocurrencies are ranked depending on their 24-hour trading volume. By clicking on any cryptocurrency, users will be able to view charts, various exchanges with details of trading volume and price, along with social media feeds such as links to recent tweets and Reddit posts.
Launched in 2014, WorldCoinIndex aims to simplify the process of picking the right exchange at the right time. The platform has gradually expanded its list of cryptocurrency information offering by adding new tradable cryptocurrencies and functionalities on a regular basis. For the index formula, WorldCoinIndex uses an average weighted price of all cryptocurrencies across all the supported exchanges.
As bitcoin is currently the most popular and widely used cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin Price Index on WorldCoinIndex serves as a base for all other cryptocurrency price indexes, such as the Ethereum price index. According to the official announcement, the Bitcoin price index calculates each market individually.
“The recent upgrades allow WorldCoinIndex to deliver real-time live stream price information. Processing real-time quotes are important for the cryptocurrency market, that is finally catching up to the standards of fiat stock and fx markets. For traders, real-time quotes can make a difference as even the smallest time discrepancy between a provided quote and the real-time situation can change a profitable trade into a loss”, the announcement reads.
