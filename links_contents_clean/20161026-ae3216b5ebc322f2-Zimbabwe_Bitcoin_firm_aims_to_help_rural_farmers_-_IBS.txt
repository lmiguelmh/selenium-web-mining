Zimbabwe Bitcoin firm aims to help rural farmers
 A Bitcoin startup is at the forefront of an initiative that looks to open up the idea of Bitcoin to farmers in Zimbabwe.
Bitmari, which operates a remittance service for the African market, has been aiming to extend its services to a group of rural female farmers. The firm has helped set up the Zimbabwe Women Farmers Association to assist women from ten rural provinces by granting them Bitcoins funded from a crowdfunding campaign.
The currency can be used to employ farming experts, help the purchasing of supplies and the exporting of goods. Any Bitcoins repaid by the farmers from their efforts would then be passed onto the next group, Bitmari says.
Bitmari is hoping to raise the awareness of Bitcoin’s viability as it works to meet regulatory requirements in Zimbabwe. The firm entered its “beta phase” at the beginning of the year.
