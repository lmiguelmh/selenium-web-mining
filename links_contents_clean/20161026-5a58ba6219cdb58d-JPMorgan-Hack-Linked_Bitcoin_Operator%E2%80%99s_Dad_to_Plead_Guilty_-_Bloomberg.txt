Michael Murgio scheduled to enter plea Thursday in probe
A Florida man with ties to an illegal Bitcoin exchange that was allegedly used by hackers who targeted companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. is scheduled to plead guilty to undisclosed charges Thursday.
U.S. prosecutors asked a judge in New York to hold a hearing for Michael Murgio, the father of the bitcoin exchange operator, Anthony Murgio. Michael Murgio’s lawyer, Stuart Kaplan, confirmed his client intends to plead guilty at the hearing.
Prosecutors have said the hacking ring, which targeted publishing and financial firms that also included Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, engaged in pump-and-dump stock scams and online gambling, generating hundreds of millions of dollars.
Anthony Murgio was accused of operating the bitcoin-exchange service, called Coin.mx, for Gery Shalon, the alleged leader and self-described "founder" of the enterprise. Anthony’s father Michael was charged with conspiring to commit money laundering.
Jose Freundt, one of Anthony Murgio’s employees at coin.mx, pleaded guilty Oct. 13 to six criminal counts, including operating an unlicensed money-transfer business. Freundt is free on bail.
The case is U.S. v. Murgio, 15-cr-00769, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan)
