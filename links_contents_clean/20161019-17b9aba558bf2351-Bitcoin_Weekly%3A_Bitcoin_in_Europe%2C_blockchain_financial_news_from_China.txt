In this week’s Bitcoin Weekly Circle, a competitive Bitcoin web-wallet, added Euro currency support for numerous European customer and Bitcoin hardware wallet TREZOR has teamed up with European Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.
In international financial technology and blockchain news, the Chinese government has published a whitepaper on the current status quo and future of blockchain development and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange just launched a suite of blockchain-based tools for financial management, including voting, securities exchange among others.
As for the Bitcoin market value, the price of BTC is hovering around $631.50 (BitcoinAverage.com). This is a little bit of a dip since last week, where the BTC price remained around $640 for the past seven days, but suddenly dropped early the morning of Oct. 19.

Chinese government IT industry ministry publishes blockchain whitepaper
The Chinese government just published a blockchain whitepaper speaking to the status quo and future trends in blockchain technology entitled “China’s Blockchain Technology and Application Development Whitepaper 2016.”
According to Bitkan (Digital Singularity Technology Co. Ltd.), a China-based over the counter bitcoin trading platform, the white paper was published with guidance from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Standardization Committee.
The whitepaper highlights current and future trends in blockchain technology as it pertains to finance, supply-chain, entertainment, smart manufacturing, social welfare, education and employment (among other sectors).
As financial technology is a major focus of blockchain technology, the whitepaper spends a lot of time on that subject. The use of blockchain technology has been sought after to assist the finance sector by securing financial instruments in scenarios such as payment, asset management, securities, clearing and settlement and user ID.
It is also noted by the whitepaper that because industries surrounding blockchain development are still nascent, meaning that standardization and standards are not prevalent. As the whitepaper is published by a government, standardization would make it easier to regulate the use of such a technology.
TREZOR teams up with Bitstamp for increased bitcoin trade security
Bitcoin hardware wallet maker TREZOR (SatoshiLabs Inc.) has teamed up with Bitcoin exchange platform Bitstamp Ltd., the fifth-largest European exchange, to provide increased user security and a better trading experience.

It is now also possible to deposit bitcoins from a TREZOR hardware wallet to Bitstamp without having to go through the myTrezor.com or any other web wallet, or having to copy-paste a bitcoin address.
Security remains the same as with any other TREZOR transfer for withdrawals and deposits: enter PIN using the hardware wallet and confirm the transaction using the hardware wallet device.
