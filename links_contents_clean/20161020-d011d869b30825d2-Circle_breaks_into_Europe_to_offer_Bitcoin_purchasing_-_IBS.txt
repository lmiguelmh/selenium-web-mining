Circle breaks into Europe to offer Bitcoin purchasing
 Bitcoin firm Circle has added support for the buying and selling of the cryptocurrency in a number of European countries beyond the UK. Circle gained an electronic money licence from the British government earlier in the year but immediately began pushing into other European markets. Now users from 16 countries can link their debit and credit cards with Circle to buy Bitcoins. Nine of the new zones will also allow users to hold Euros and Bitcoins in their wallets simultaneously.
Circle, which gained $60 million in funding from Chinese backers in summer, is a supporter of advancing the use public blockchains, going against the grain of the industry, which is scrambling to find solid use cases for private, permissioned blockchains.
“We’d be thrilled if everyone in the world enjoyed Circle,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People benefit most if Circle is part of an open global network of value exchange with thousands of other software providers, online services, and financial institutions who are connecting to and innovating on public blockchains.”
