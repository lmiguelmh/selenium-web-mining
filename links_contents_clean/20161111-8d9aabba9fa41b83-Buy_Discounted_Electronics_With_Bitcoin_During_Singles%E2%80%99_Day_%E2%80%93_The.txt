Buy Discounted Electronics With Bitcoin During Singles’ Day
It is a special holiday among Asian shoppers today, as November 11th is Singles Day. Unlike the Western world’s Valentine’s Day, this holiday is the one day of the year where consumers are nudged to buy things for themselves rather than someone else. Good discounts can be scored among sites such as AliExpress, Banggood, and Gearbest. In fact, it is possible to spend Bitcoin there too, albeit with a slight workaround.
SINGLES DAY IS THE SHOPPING EVENT FOR INDIVIDUALS
Our society has many strange holidays, most of which have an origin very few people care about. A holiday is an excellent reason not to go to work, depending on which sector one is active in. But in Asia, they take this day very seriously, as it is the Black Friday of Asian shopping, so to speak.
Major outlets such as AliExpress, Banggood, and Gearbest have substantial discounts throughout the day, ranging between 30 and 50% in most cases. For anyone looking to buy something for themselves, this is the day to score some bargains. Ranging from electronics to fashion and kitchen equipment to pet toys, everything is discounted.
Bitcoin users can take part in this special event as well, as there are multiple portals accepting Bitcoin payments for these sites. Granted, they are all intermediate services, but it offers Bitcoin users a way to spend cryptocurrency on their discounted purchases. After all, cryptocurrency must be spent as a regular currency, rather than sit in a wallet.
Another option is to use one of the many Bitcoin debit cards in existence. AliExpress and consorts all accept either PayPal or credit card payments directly, and none of these services is discriminating between Bitcoin cards or bank cards. In fact, Singles’ Day is a great day to explore Bitcoin Debit card offerings, which are plentiful these days.
It will take some time until these Asian retailers accept Bitcoin payments directly. Most of them are located in China, a region where bitcoin regulation can be introduced at any time. Moreover, the PBOC advised companies not to deal in Bitcoin directly several years ago, and a lot of business owners stick to that warning.
One thing is certain: Bitcoin users are crafty and will find a way to spend cryptocurrency on whatever it is they need. Singles’ Day is a perfect holiday for the geeks among us, as plenty of electronics can be snatched up for bottom prices. Moreover, those special people in your life deserve a gift now and then, and now is a good time to stock up on Christmas presents.
